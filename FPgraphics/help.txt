1. Roll the dice to begin.

2. You can launch a piece whenever the dice shows 6.   

3. Move a piece on the board clockwise with the number     
of steps indicated by the dice. 

4. When your piece meets your opponent's piece, you
'eat' the piece by returning the opponent's piece 
back to its hangar and continue moving your piece.
If your piece lands on the shortcut spot where the
opponent's piece landed, you will not 'eat' it.

5. When your piece lands on the shortcut spots and 
the color of your piece matches that of the shortcut
spot, you can take the shortcut indicated by the 
dotted arrow. After you took the shortcut, if the
opponent's piece was there, you will 'eat' it.

6. The game ends when a player has its four pieces
landed in the center box.
