Flying Chess: single player version

The Final Project of CS111: Intro to Computer Science, Carleton College, Fall 2014

Human v.s. Computer (with some level of AI)

First created a text-based version where a human player uses the terminal window to control the chesses and read game information;

Then updated the game with a graphics-based version where a human player interacts with both the terminal window and the graphic chess board to have a more direct intuition about the game
