# What is Aeroplane Chess?
[Aeroplane Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroplane_Chess) (simplified Chinese: 飞行棋; traditional Chinese: 飛行棋; pinyin: fēixíng qí, literally "Aviation Game" or "Flying Chess") is a Chinese cross-and-circle board game similar to the western game of Ludo and the Indian game of Pachisi. Developed in the 20th century, Aeroplane Chess features airplanes as pieces instead of the more abstract pawns and beehive-shaped pieces found in the games from which it is derived.

# What did I make?
### Aeroplane Chess - Single Player Version

This is the final project for my CS111: Intro to Computer Science at Carleton College, Fall 2014.

The game is Human vs Computer.

First I created a [text-based version](https://github.com/yinghj/FlyingChess/tree/master/FPtext) where a human player uses the terminal window to control the chesses and read game information. 


then I updated the game with a [graphics-based version](https://github.com/yinghj/FlyingChess/tree/master/FPgraphics) where a human player interacts with both the terminal window and the graphic chess board to have a more direct intuition about the game.

# How to Start the Game?
In either the text-based or graphics-based version folder, type `python system` in the terminal to run `system.py` and start the game.
